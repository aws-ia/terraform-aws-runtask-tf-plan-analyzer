* The GitHub token needs to be a [fine-grained personal access tokens](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/managing-your-personal-access-tokens#creating-a-fine-grained-personal-access-token) with the following permissions:

* Read access to metadata
* Read and Write access to pull requests

* Deploy the module

  ```bash
  terraform init
  terraform plan
  terraform apply
  ```

* (Optional, if using HCP Terraform) Add the cloud block in `providers.tf`

  ```hcl
  terraform {

    cloud {
      # TODO: Change this to your HCP Terraform org name.
      organization = "<enter your org name here>"
      workspaces {
        ...
      }
    }
    ...
  }
  ```
