# Usage Example

This is a basic example setup on using the module.

* Make sure the Docker image has been built and pushed from the `src` folder, [follow this Readme](../../src/README.md)

* Create infrastrucutre

  ```bash
  terraform init
  terraform plan
  terraform apply
  ```

* (Optional, if using HCP Terraform) Add the cloud block in `providers.tf`

  ```hcl
  terraform {

    cloud {
      # TODO: Change this to your HCP Terraform org name.
      organization = "<enter your org name here>"
      workspaces {
        ...
      }
    }
    ...
  }
  ```
