# Runtask Terraform Plan Analyzer

## Overview

Enhance your HashiCorp Cloud Platform Terraform (Terraform Cloud) workflows with AI-powered analysis using Amazon Bedrock. This module integrates seamlessly as a Run Task to provide:

* Intelligent Terraform plan analysis with concise, human-friendly summaries
* Advanced function calling capabilities for extended analysis (e.g., AMI evaluation)
* Responsible AI implementation with customizable guardrails

### Key Features

1. **AI-Powered Plan Summaries**
   * Generate clear, natural language summaries of Terraform plan outputs
   * Quickly understand the impact of infrastructure changes

## Architecture

![Diagram](./images/arch.png)

This module leverages a hub-spoke model, designed for deployment in a dedicated AWS account with Amazon Bedrock access. It utilizes AWS Lambda, CloudFront, and other AWS services to provide a scalable and secure solution.

## Prerequisites

To implement this module, you'll need:

1. An AWS account with appropriate credentials
2. Access to Amazon Bedrock (default model: Claude 3 Sonnet)
3. A HashiCorp Cloud Platform (HCP) Terraform account

## Getting Started

For detailed setup instructions and best practices, please refer to the sections below:

* [Usage](#usage)
* [Best Practices](#best-practice)

Enhance your Terraform workflows with AI-powered insights while maintaining security and responsible AI practices.

## Usage

* Build and package the Lambda files

  ```
  make all
  ```

* Enable Bedrock model access for `Claude 3 Sonnet`. Refer to [this guide for more info](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/bedrock/latest/userguide/model-access.html).

* Reference the `examples/basic` folder on how to use this module

    ```sh
    cd examples/basic
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```

## Best practice

* **Do not** re-use the Run Tasks URL across different trust-boundary (organizations, accounts, team). We recommend you to deploy separate Run Task deployment per trust-boundary.

* **Do not** use Run Tasks URL from untrusted party, remember that Run Tasks execution sent Terraform plan output to the Run Task endpoint. Only use trusted Run Tasks URL.

* Enable the AWS WAF setup by setting variable `deploy_waf` to `true` (additional cost will apply). This will add WAF protection to the Run Tasks URL endpoint.

* We recommend you to setup additional CloudWatch alarm to monitor Lambda concurrency and WAF rules.

* We recommend to add additional topic to the Bedrock Guardrail to fit your organization requirements.
