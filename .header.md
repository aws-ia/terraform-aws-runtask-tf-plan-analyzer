## Prerequisites

To use this module you need have the following:

1. AWS account and credentials
1. HCP Terraform account

## Usage

1. Reference the `examples/basic` folder on how to use this module

    ```sh
    cd examples/basic
    terraform init
    terraform plan
    terraform apply
    ```

## Best practice

* **Do not** re-use the Run Tasks URL across different trust-boundary (organizations, accounts, team). We recommend you to deploy separate Run Task deployment per trust-boundary.

* **Do not** use Run Tasks URL from untrusted party, remember that Run Tasks execution sent Terraform plan output to the Run Task endpoint. Only use trusted Run Tasks URL.

* Enable the AWS WAF setup by setting variable `deploy_waf` to `true` (additional cost will apply). This will add WAF protection to the Run Tasks URL endpoint.

* We recommend you to setup additional CloudWatch alarm to monitor Lambda concurrency and WAF rules.
